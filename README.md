# Project Title
Data Analysis of Udemy Course dataset using SQL and Tableau

# Project Description, Introduction and Objective
In this project, data science & analytics skills were used to explore the data, perform analysis, create visualizations, and generate insights. 
The dataset used was obtained from Kaggle, which includes columns such as 'Course_id', 'Course_title', 'Url', 'Free_beginner course', 'Price', 'Number of Subscribers',
'Number of reviews', 'Number of Lectures', 'Level', 'Rating', 'Content duration', 'Published timestamp', 'Subject', 'Date', 'Free_paid'.

The Course database was created in Postgresql with the table which contains the columns listed above. The data was inspected, so as to have an understanding of 
some of its features, check for missing values and duplicates. Analysis was then performed on the data by answering certain questions using SQL, followed by getting
more insight by visualization using Tableau. The following questions are answered during the analysis:

* Which is the subject with most subscribers?
* Which subject has the highest number of reviews?
* Which subject has the highest number of subscribers based on levels?
* Which subject has the highest average price based on the levels?
* Which subject has the highest average rating based on the levels?
* What is the total number of subscribers for free and paid courses?
* What is the trend of courses over time?
